# Document Wording

It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns in the event of a 'crisis', but there is no mention of a return of power to Okforth at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control of both towns permanently.
