  blurb: '# $[objectname]


    This is an area that stretches from **$[xxnjogoqxa]** in the west to the twin
    towns of **$[mtugsijbql]** and **$[uqgfukuaht]** in the east to **$[kvsxvfmdfh]**
    in the North.


    ## Wetlands


    The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater,
    is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather.
    When the area floods, the only way to get to $[kvsxvfmdfh] is by boat as the road
    becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from $[xxnjogoqxa].


    ## The Rocky River


    To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests
    is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters,
    make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but
    even they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially
    when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the
    shoes is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate
    the river.


    Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single
    road passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


    ## Woodlands


    At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**,
    and some open grassland areas.

      A $[twwfzayehs] town on the coast of $[jiweqnxbdg], at the west end of the $[hjelnwbcjp].
      The town has a large port and and is a key trade and transport hub for ships
      to a number of towns and cities around the lake.


      ## Points of Interest


      - **The Broken Vase Tavern**

      - **$[ruynchekbj]**


      The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a
      smallish town, although there isn''t much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist
      shops and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of
      magic user in general and may not be as welcoming to them.

    blurb: '# $[objectname]


      On the eastern edge of the $[twwfzayehs] region, what is seemingly one large
      walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate
      towns. On the west side is **$[mtugsijbql]**, on the east is **$[uqgfukuaht]**.
      They are connected by a number of bridges.


      The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing
      and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong
      desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.


      The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but
      there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the
      more you dig for it. You wouldn''t notice by looking but there is some real
      hatred between the towns.


      ## Key Positioning


      The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the $[hjelnwbcjp] and
      act as a gateway to the lands to the east.


      The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing
      traffic to other ports around $[jiweqnxbdg] which would mean few would come
      through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.

      meets $[jiweqnxbdg]. The town has a small dock and does not have the capacity
      of the harbour in $[xxnjogoqxa].


      The town doesn''t get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road
      is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and
      their families. Over time, the population is falling as people move to more

        A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines.
        It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to
        work out how to operate it in many generations.


        ## Known History


        The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven
        carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in $[kvsxvfmdfh]. He
        was famed for building ''indestructible'' ships and lived a happy life in
        the village until his passing.


        ## Secret History


        Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with $[mxanfuwhdl]
        it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more
        than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel
        and cannot burn.


        The magic wasn''t permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost
        its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.


        Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded
        where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.


        ## But It Is Being Used


        After following leads and rumours, $[iokwfwzhvc] have recently been able to
        find $[mxanfuwhdl] and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood
        with the same magical power as before.


        $[nzgcbdcnjn] was built here.'

      This is the road between $[kvsxvfmdfh] and $[mtugsijbql]. It is a much smaller
      road than $[hjelnwbcjp] and has to go through the wetlands which frequently
      make the road impassable.'

      is where is $[ftwwvwecmn] often found as he checks people and good in and out
      of the hideout.

      would contain a few rooms.


      ## Basement

      and comprises of a number of rooms. There is another exit through a hatch directly
