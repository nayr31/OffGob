  - **The Broken Vase Tavern**

  - **$[ruynchekbj]**


  The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a smallish
  town, although there isn''t much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist shops
  and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of magic user
  in general and may not be as welcoming to them.
