blurb: '# $[objectname]


  The road connecting $[xxnjogoqxa] and the twin towns of $[mtugsijbql] and $[uqgfukuaht].


  ## Bandits

  Bandits are frequently seen along the road and holds-ups are commonplace. Most merchants
  and travelers will hire protection for the journey along the road.


  In the last few months, a man named $[omhfhzfhxc] has set up a business organising
  safe passage along the road, directly employing protection and running frequent
  group trips at a more affordable cost to individuals than if they were to go alone.'
