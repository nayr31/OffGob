blurb: '# $[objectname]


  The town on the western side of the river.


  ## Points of Interest


  - **Tavern** - The Owner is jealous of the tavern in Mekross and its owner''s ability
  to super-chill drinks. People seem to prefer them and often head over the river
  instead of drinking here

  - **Basic Inn** - An inn with basic facilities for travellers passing through

  - **Luxury Inn** - A much more opulent inn for those wanting a more comfortable
  stay. Comes with a matching price tag

  - **Town Council Building** - Where all offical town business is carried out

  - **Church** ($[kswascfari]) - The only church in either of the Twin Towns


  A normal array of shops and services are also available in the town.'
