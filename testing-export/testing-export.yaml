    Kothil is a male gnome and the current mayor of $[uqgfukuaht]. He has golden hair
    and brown eyes. He wears fine clothing and a mink fur cape.


    ## Political Career


    Kothil has been mayor of Mekross for around 6 months and, at 26 years old, is
    the youngest mayor ever elected.


    ## Secret


    Kothil is being blackmailed by $[iokwfwzhvc] who have put him forward as a mayoral
    candidate due to the hold they have over him and the ease they can manipulate
    him. He is allowing the bandit activity in exchange for personal money. He plans
    to take as much money as he can before fleeing somewhere far away from all of
    this with his money.'

    This is an area that stretches from **$[xxnjogoqxa]** in the west to the twin
    towns of **$[mtugsijbql]** and **$[uqgfukuaht]** in the east to **$[kvsxvfmdfh]**
    in the North.


    ## Wetlands


    The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater,
    is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather.
    When the area floods, the only way to get to $[kvsxvfmdfh] is by boat as the road
    becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from $[xxnjogoqxa].


    ## The Rocky River


    To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests
    is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters,
    make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but
    even they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially
    when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the
    shoes is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate
    the river.


    Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single
    road passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


    ## Woodlands


    At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**,
    and some open grassland areas.

      The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a

    blurb: '# $[objectname]


      On the eastern edge of the $[twwfzayehs] region, what is seemingly one large
      walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate
      towns. On the west side is **$[mtugsijbql]**, on the east is **$[uqgfukuaht]**.
      They are connected by a number of bridges.


      The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing
      and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong
      desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.


      The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but
      there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the
      more you dig for it. You wouldn''t notice by looking but there is some real
      hatred between the towns.


      ## Key Positioning


      The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the $[hjelnwbcjp] and
      act as a gateway to the lands to the east.


      The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing
      traffic to other ports around $[jiweqnxbdg] which would mean few would come
      through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.

      of the harbour in $[xxnjogoqxa].


      The town doesn''t get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road
      is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and

        A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines.
        It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to
        work out how to operate it in many generations.


        ## Known History


        The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven
        carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in $[kvsxvfmdfh]. He
        was famed for building ''indestructible'' ships and lived a happy life in
        the village until his passing.


        ## Secret History


        Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with $[mxanfuwhdl]
        it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more
        than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel
        and cannot burn.


        The magic wasn''t permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost
        its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.


        Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded
        where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.


        ## But It Is Being Used


        After following leads and rumours, $[iokwfwzhvc] have recently been able to
        find $[mxanfuwhdl] and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood
        with the same magical power as before.


        $[nzgcbdcnjn] was built here.'

      Bandits are frequently seen along the road and holds-ups are commonplace. Most

      Duskwood Den is a building complex in the Westown forest, south of the Devil''s
      highway. Its existance isn''t known by anyone outside $[iokwfwzhvc], who are
      using it as a headquarters for their raids on the nearby roads.


      ## Layout


      From the outside, it appears as a small complex surrounded by walls.


      There is a small guardhouse before getting to the main building. This guardhouse
      is where is $[ftwwvwecmn] often found as he checks people and good in and out
      of the hideout.


      Beyond that is the main building, a single storey building that looks like it
      would contain a few rooms.


      ## Basement


      One of the rooms contains a staircase down to a cellar. The cellar is very large
      and comprises of a number of rooms. There is another exit through a hatch directly
      outside the complex which is generally kept locked from both sides.'

    Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working
    for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has
    a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand
    into $[twwfzayehs].


    They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale
    is currently extremely high.


    ## Identification


    The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn
    on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform,
    as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could
    be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The
    insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels
    buildings.

    The party will need to find some information on what is going in the area. So
    far they only have rumours to go on and need to see if there is something more
    definitive to go on.


    They may decide, for example, to

    - [x] Seek out town officials

    - [ ] Ask some merchants who made trade with other towns

    - [x] Ask around in the local tavern

    - [ ] Whatever else they think of!

    - [x] Find a lead towards $[tzznfrlpqn]


    ## Progress


    Anyone in town who is willing to talk to the party will likely point them towards
    $[omhfhzfhxc] and the $[tzznfrlpqn], being the ones dealing directly with the
    problem.


    Edmor will be looking for help with $[wghdsmpvjm] and $[gphxkgmexf] and will see
    the potential of the party, offering them a reward for help.


    If the party make no progress in finding information, have Edmor come and find

    irrelevant.*


    # $[objectname]


    While travelling the road, the party will be attacked by bandits from $[iokwfwzhvc]
    (unless they take extreme measures to ensure this doesn''t happen).


    It could be daylight or overnight, depending on when they set out and may be scaled
    according to if the party have hired some additional protection.


    ## Set Up


    A very well orchestrated attack will have $[iokwfwzhvc] try and kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc].
    They have no interest in anything apart from his capture. If successful, they
    will take him to $[bhmtyxlqlm] where he will be held hostage. The reason is simply
    to disrupt the $[tzznfrlpqn] with the intentions of ending its operation.


    **Options**

    - Have the bandits attack while the party is tavelling

    - Have the bandits wait until the party stops and rests

    - Have the bandits pose as merchants escaping from bandits to try and gain the
    trust of the party. They have some magic users in their ranks so can easily pull
    of an attack with seemingly no equipment on them

    The encounter should include enough bandits to be a a reasonable threat, but it
    should include $[ftwwvwecmn] who is able to use a **scroll of slow**, **nets**
    and the **hold person spell** on the party in order to help capture Edmor.


    The main objective of the bandit attack is to capture Edmor and escape. They attackers
    will not be interested in fighting the party  unless they have to.'

    This document details the agreement between the twin towns to work together to
    allow travel between and through the towns.


    No-one knows exactly what it says (despite it being publicly available information)
    as it is too complicated for the average commoner, but there is a general understanding
    of it''s contents.


    # Document Wording


    It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to
    mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns
    in the event of a ''crisis'', but there is no mention of a return of power to
    Okforth at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control
    of both towns permanently.'

    The bandits have a few plays...


    ## Disrupt The Trade Routes


    Disrupting the trade routes will cause uncertainty in the area and force trade
    around the whispering sea, including to other towns that they already have a stronger
    foothold in.


    ## Infiltrate Twin Towns Councils


    Meanwhile, they are using the compromised $[bkzzzegnhx] to gain influence in $[uqgfukuaht]
    with the intention of exploiting the clause in the $[sxfvfucbjd] to take control
    of $[mtugsijbql].


    ## Use The Sawmill


    With the knowledge of how to work $[jjrzlmtvbm] and what it can do, they plan
    to use items made there to to help their cause as well as providing an additional
    legitimate income stream.'

    Is a carved wooden cage, comfortably big enough for a human but with gaps between
    the ''bars'' that are too small for a medium humanoid to fit through. It is made
    from a single piece of the trunk of a large tree so there are no joins or seams.


    ## Secret


    It was built in $[jjrzlmtvbm] and while it remains more than 1 mile from there,
    it will be as hard as the strongest steel and almost unbreakable. It is, however
    much lighter than steel and will float.


    ## Inhabitent


    If the bandits successfully kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc], he will be put in the box. Otherwise
    another member of $[tzznfrlpqn] or just a random NPC. If the camping doesn''t
    go according to plan, it could even end up with a PC in there!


    The creature will be put into the cage via a (homebrew) teleport spell and an
    anti-magic field is then cast on the inside of the cage via a scroll. This should
    mean that there is no easy way out - no teleports, no bag of holding, etc.


    ## Why Are they Doing This?


    As a scare tactic to the $[tzznfrlpqn]. $[iokwfwzhvc] are planning on sneaking
    this into $[mtugsijbql] after a few nights (enough time for people to notice $[omhfhzfhxc]
    is missing), attach it to the floor in the market square, and leave it with a
    message to warn the Devil''s Protection to halt operations and for travelers find
    alternative routes.'

    This is a small hexagonal amulet on a silver chain. It is made from wood and has
    a carving of an anvil on the front. The chain is looking a little worse for wares
    but the pendant is in pristine condition.


    ## Secret


    The amulet is the key to $[jjrzlmtvbm] and had been lost for generations. It was
    recently found by $[mqphnewbpw] who has found the secret of the sawmill. The pendant
    itself is virtually indestructible.'

    In the $[bhmtyxlqlm] $[cajumixska], the party will come across $[mqphnewbpw].
    She will be accompanied by a number of bandits who will fight to the death for
    her, but she will not stay and fight herself. As soon as she knows of the party''s
    presence in the den, she will run through the western-tunnel exit then bolt an
    lock the hatch from the outside.


    Once outside, she will grab a horse from the front of the complex, ride to $[xxnjogoqxa]
    and board an $[iokwfwzhvc] boat headed for $[svflxcdrna].


    The bandits in the den will serve to delay the party long enough for Scars to
    get a good head-start.


    There should be some indication of where she headed, maybe **a note left in the
    corridor telling her to flee to Westown** that the party can find.'
