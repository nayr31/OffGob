# $[objectname]

The party will need to find some information on what is going in the area. So far they only have rumours to go on and need to see if there is something more definitive to go on.

They may decide, for example, to
- [x] Seek out town officials
- [ ] Ask some merchants who made trade with other towns
- [x] Ask around in the local tavern
- [ ] Whatever else they think of!
- [x] Find a lead towards $[tzznfrlpqn]

## Progress

Anyone in town who is willing to talk to the party will likely point them towards $[omhfhzfhxc] and the $[tzznfrlpqn], being the ones dealing directly with the problem.

Edmor will be looking for help with $[wghdsmpvjm] and $[gphxkgmexf] and will see the potential of the party, offering them a reward for help.

If the party make no progress in finding information, have Edmor come and find them, having noticed them and their potential.
