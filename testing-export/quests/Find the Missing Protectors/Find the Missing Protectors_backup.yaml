blurb: '# $[objectname]


  Some of the $[tzznfrlpqn] have not come back from their latest commission. **$[uqmasyyfck]**
  and **$[bmulwambsf]** were accompanying a convoy of five caravans to $[xxnjogoqxa]
  but there has been no sign of either the protectors or the caravans since they left.

  ## Secret


  They were attacked along $[hjelnwbcjp] by a larger and more organised group of bandits
  than has been making other recent attacks. Both protectors survived the attack but
  were left effectively for dead. They were able to gather themselves enough to go
  looking for food and water but ended up being caught be spiders who entwined them
  in webs to die.
