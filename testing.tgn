      # $[objectname]


      A @[](twwfzayehs) town on the coast of @[](jiweqnxbdg), at the west end of the @[](hjelnwbcjp). The town has a large port and and is a key trade and transport hub for ships to a number of towns and cities around the lake.


      ## Points of Interest


      - **The Broken Vase Tavern**

      - **@[](ruynchekbj)**


      The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a smallish town, although there isn't much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist shops and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of magic user in general and may not be as welcoming to them.

        The town on the western side of the river.


        ## Points of Interest


        - **Tavern** - The Owner is jealous of the tavern in Mekross and its owner's ability to super-chill drinks. People seem to prefer them and often head over the river instead of drinking here

        - **Basic Inn** - An inn with basic facilities for travellers passing through

        - **Luxury Inn** - A much more opulent inn for those wanting a more comfortable stay. Comes with a matching price tag

        - **Town Council Building** - Where all offical town business is carried out

        - **Church** (@[](kswascfari)) - The only church in either of the Twin Towns


        A normal array of shops and services are also available in the town.

      # $[objectname]


      On the eastern edge of the @[](twwfzayehs) region, what is seemingly one large walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate towns. On the west side is **@[](mtugsijbql)**, on the east is **@[](uqgfukuaht)**. They are connected by a number of bridges.


      The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.


      The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the more you dig for it. You wouldn't notice by looking but there is some real hatred between the towns.


      ## Key Positioning


      The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the @[](hjelnwbcjp) and act as a gateway to the lands to the east.


      The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing traffic to other ports around @[](jiweqnxbdg) which would mean few would come through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.

        # $[objectname]


        A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.


        ## Known History


        The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in @[](kvsxvfmdfh). He was famed for building 'indestructible' ships and lived a happy life in the village until his passing.


        !!


        ## Secret History


        Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with the @[](mxanfuwhdl) it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel and cannot burn.


        The magic wasn't permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.


        Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.


        ## But it is Being Used


        After following leads and rumours, @[](iokwfwzhvc) have recently been able to find the @[](mxanfuwhdl) and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood with the same magical power as before.


        @[](nzgcbdcnjn) was built here.

      # $[objectname]


      A small town in the @[](twwfzayehs) region, on the shore where **The Rocky River** meets @[](jiweqnxbdg). The town has a small dock and does not have the capacity of the harbour in @[](xxnjogoqxa).


      The town doesn't get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and their families. Over time, the population is falling as people move to more prosperous towns.


      ## Points Of Interest


      - **Tavern** - A modest tavern who can also scramble together some basic accommodation if needed

      - **The Dock** - Mainly just local fishing boats. Some boats are willing to transport people and small cargo down to @[](xxnjogoqxa)

      - **@[](jjrzlmtvbm)**

      - **Woodworkers** - There are a few woodworkers in the town who make a living fixing up fishing boats and creating and fixing tools for use on the boats

      - **Blacksmiths** - As the woodworkers, the local blacksmith makes a living making and fixing objects for the boats


      ---


      There are a few people who believe they have heard sounds from the sawmill recently but they are not being taken seriously by the rest of the village.

        # $[objectname]


        While travelling the road, the party will be attacked by bandits from $[iokwfwzhvc] (unless they take extreme measures to ensure this doesn't happen).


        It could be daylight or overnight, depending on when they set out and may be scaled according to if the party have hired some additional protection.


        ## Set Up


        A very well orchestrated attack will have $[iokwfwzhvc] try and kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc]. They have no interest in anything apart from his capture. If successful, they will take him to $[bhmtyxlqlm] where he will be held hostage. The reason is simply to disrupt the $[tzznfrlpqn] with the intentions of ending its operation.


        **Options**

        - Have the bandits attack while the party is tavelling

        - Have the bandits wait until the party stops and rests

        - Have the bandits pose as merchants escaping from bandits to try and gain the trust of the party. They have some magic users in their ranks so can easily pull of an attack with seemingly no equipment on them


        ---


        The encounter should include enough bandits to be a a reasonable threat, but it should include $[ftwwvwecmn] who is able to use a **scroll of slow**, **nets** and the **hold person spell** on the party in order to help capture Edmor.


        The main objective of the bandit attack is to capture Edmor and escape. They attackers will not be interested in fighting the party  unless they have to.

      The road connecting @[](xxnjogoqxa) and the twin towns of @[](mtugsijbql) and @[](uqgfukuaht).


      ## Bandits

      Bandits are frequently seen along the road and holds-ups are commonplace. Most merchants and travelers will hire protection for the journey along the road.


      In the last few months, a man named @[](omhfhzfhxc) has set up a business organising safe passage along the road, directly employing protection and running frequent group trips at a more affordable cost to individuals than if they were to go alone.

          In the $[bhmtyxlqlm] $[cajumixska], the party's prescience may be noticed by the very observant lookouts. If this is the case, @[](mqphnewbpw) will flee through the western-tunnel exit then bolt an lock the hatch from the outside, leaving @[](ftwwvwecmn) and the rest of the bandits to fight. While fleeing, she will drop her @[](rplgaqbqtx).


          Once outside, she will grab a horse from the front of the complex, ride to $[xxnjogoqxa] and board an $[iokwfwzhvc] boat headed for $[svflxcdrna].


          The bandits in the den will serve to delay the party long enough for Scars to get a good head-start.


          ## Fight


          - @[](ftwwvwecmn)

          - 4x Bandits

        The basement is very large (much larger than the building above) and comprises of a number of rooms. In the north-west corner, there is a ladder leading to up to a hatch. The hatch open up inside the trunk of a large dead tree in the forest. It can be bolted and locked from top and bottom to be secured without someone opening it from both sides.


        ## Layout


        ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Mcqk0f.png)


        ## Rooms


        ### Top Left


        This looks to be an operations room of some kind. There is some paperwork laying around, it all looks above board for a legitimate import/export business.


        There is a hastily scribbled note saying  "*had to leave, normal route west*". It is signed with the initial **S**.


        ### Bottom Left


        General Store Room - Full of provisions, basic goods that have been stolen from merchants, etc.


        ### Top Right


        Has a number of bed rolls spread out on the floor, it is being used by the Fist for members to sleep when they need to hide or be in the area.

      Duskwood Den is a building complex in the Westown forest, south of the Devil's highway. Its existance isn't known by anyone outside $[iokwfwzhvc], who are using it as a headquarters for their raids on the nearby roads.


      ## Layout


      From the outside, it appears as a small complex surrounded by walls.


      There is a small guardhouse before getting to the main building. This guardhouse is where is $[ftwwvwecmn] often found as he checks people and good in and out of the hideout.


      Beyond that is the main building, a single storey building that looks like it would contain a few rooms.


      ## Basement


      One of the rooms contains a staircase down to a cellar. The cellar is very large and comprises of a number of rooms. There is another exit through a hatch directly outside the complex which is generally kept locked from both sides.

    This is an area that stretches from @[](xxnjogoqxa) in the west to the twin towns of @[](mtugsijbql) and @[](uqgfukuaht) in the east to @[](kvsxvfmdfh) in the North.


    ## Wetlands


    The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater, is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather. When the area floods, the only way to get to @[](kvsxvfmdfh) is by boat as the road becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from @[](xxnjogoqxa).


    ## The Rocky River


    To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters, make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but even they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the shoes is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate the river.


    Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single road passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


    ## Woodlands


    At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**, and some open grassland areas.

        ***Multiattack.*** $[objectname] makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.


        ***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: rollable(dice=1d20+5,dicelabel=Scimitar: To Hit,label=+5) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (rollable(dice=1d6 + 3,dicelabel=Scimitar: Damage)) slashing damage.

      # $[objectname]


      Slender to the point of emaciation, her muted emerald eyes avoid your gaze. Though her milk-white skin is uncommonly pale, some effort has been made with makeup to add some color to her cheeks. The elf wears a worn and practical suit of studded leather, but a satchel bulges at her side, and her dark hair has been combed back in an equally businesslike fashion.


      !!


      ## Alter Ego



      Keldan goes by the name **Scars** in her role as leader of @[](iokwfwzhvc) and is the one ordering the attacks on targets along the @[](hjelnwbcjp), @[](qesmbwnchf) and surrounding areas.


      Scars is her bandit persona, she makes absolutely sure to not have her real name known by anyone who knows her as Scars and tries to limit the number of people she actually sees to avoid the possibility of anyone finding out.

      A black cat who often follows $[ukqnmaekls] around town and stays close to him.


      !!


      ## Secret


      Isabelle is a human who polymorphed into a cat around 1 year ago. After she stayed close by for some time, $[ukqnmaekls] eventually was able to find someone to cast a spell allowing him to speak with animals when he found out the truth. Since then he has been seeking a cure.


      Wilhye doesn't have much to pay for help in finding a cure and is concerned with revealing the truth, so is seeking to learn to cast spells himself in order to remove the effect.


      *His magical path, being a cleric, won't see him able to cast the required spells even if he were able to learn quick enough before the natural life of the cat comes to an end. He will need help but doesn't know it yet.*

    Inchel Keldan is known as **Scars** by anyone connected to the Fist. She keeps her private and Fist "personas" very seperate.

    They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale is currently extremely high.


    ## Identification


    The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform, as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels buildings.

    The party will need to find some information on what is going in the area. So far you only have rumours to go on and need to see if there is something more definitive to go on.


    !!


    They may decide, for example, to

    - Seek out town officials

    - Ask some merchants who made trade with other towns

    - Ask around in the local tavern

    - Whatever else they think of!

    - Find a lead towards @[](tzznfrlpqn)


    !!


    !!


    ## Progress


    Anyone in town who is willing to talk to the party will likely point them towards @[](omhfhzfhxc) and the @[](tzznfrlpqn), being the ones dealing directly with the problem.


    Edmor will be looking for help with @[](wghdsmpvjm) and @[](gphxkgmexf) and will see the potential of the party, offering them a reward for help.


    If the party make no progress in finding information, have Edmor come and find them, having noticed them and their potential.

      Once the party has


      - Learned about the existence of @[](iokwfwzhvc)
        - People in the towns will likely know of their existence, especially those that have had direct run-ins with them
        - Some people may offer red herrings based on their own ideas of who is behind the attacks
      - Found out they are led by Scars

      - Had enough pointers that the Fist are behind the attacks


      They can move to step @[](vhyytjfazu).

      You have learned that the bandit attacks are being organised by members of @[](iokwfwzhvc), and organisation said to be led by someone named "@[Scars](mqphnewbpw)". You need to see if you can find some information about them.


      !!


      ## Progression


      Once the party has


      - Found out the Fist have an HQ somewhere nearby
        - General rumours may reveal this
        - Maybe some town officials will have this info
      - Learned of @[](bhmtyxlqlm)
        - Find some bandits and interrogate or tail them
        - A lot of questions
        - Look for clues in a recent attack site - maybe something was left - a note, even a map!

      They can move on to @[](gfqfxcabiy)

    ***Note:*** The expected course of action is to simply go in and kill @[](iokwfwzhvc) leaders. But maybe the party want to go about it another way... Reason with them? Take control of the organisation themselves and steer it in another direction? Something else?

    Some of the @[](tzznfrlpqn) have not come back from their latest commission. **@[](uqmasyyfck)** and **@[](bmulwambsf)** were accompanying a convoy of five caravans to @[](xxnjogoqxa) but there has been no sign of either the protectors or the caravans since they left.


    !!


    ## Secret


    They were attacked along @[](hjelnwbcjp) by a larger and more organised group of bandits than has been making other recent attacks. Both protectors survived the attack but were left effectively for dead. They were able to gather themselves enough to go looking for food and water but ended up being caught be spiders who entwined them in webs to die.

      One way would be to take the cage to @[](jjrzlmtvbm) where it's magic dispels and they can cut or break into it easily.

      ## Disrupt The Trade Routes


      Disrupting the trade routes will cause uncertainty in the area and force trade around the whispering sea, including to other towns that they already have a stronger foothold in.


      ## Infiltrate Twin Towns Councils


      Meanwhile, they are using the compromised @[](bkzzzegnhx) to gain influence in @[](uqgfukuaht) with the intention of exploiting the clause in the @[](sxfvfucbjd) to take control of @[](mtugsijbql).

      No-one knows exactly what it says (despite it being publicly available information) as it is too complicated for the average commoner, but there is a general understanding of it's contents.


      # Document Wording


      It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns in the event of a 'crisis', but there is no mention of a return of power to Okforth at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control of both towns permanently.

      Is a carved wooden cage, comfortably big enough for a human but with gaps between the 'bars' that are too small for a medium humanoid to fit through. It is made from a single piece of the trunk of a large tree so there are no joins or seams.


      Although made from wood, it is far stronger than it seemingly should be, attempts to cut or break the structure have all failed so far.


      !!


      ## Secret


      It was built in @[](jjrzlmtvbm) and while it remains more than 1 mile from there, it will be as hard as the strongest steel and almost unbreakable. It is, however much lighter than steel and will float.


      ## Inhabitent


      If the bandits successfully kidnap @[](omhfhzfhxc), he will be put in the box. Otherwise another member of @[](tzznfrlpqn) or just a random NPC. If the camping doesn't go according to plan, it could even end up with a PC in there!


      The creature will be put into the cage via a (homebrew) teleport spell and an anti-magic field is then cast on the inside of the cage via a scroll. This should mean that there is no easy way out - no teleports, no bag of holding, etc.


      ## Why Are they Doing This?


      As a scare tactic to the @[](tzznfrlpqn). @[](iokwfwzhvc) are planning on sneaking this into @[](mtugsijbql) after a few nights (enough time for people to notice @[](omhfhzfhxc) is missing), attach it to the floor in the market square, and leave it with a message to warn the Devil's Protection to halt operations and for travelers find alternative routes.

      The amulet is the key to @[](jjrzlmtvbm) and had been lost for generations. It was recently found by @[](mqphnewbpw) who has found the secret of the sawmill. The pendant itself is virtually indestructible.

      This locket was found in @[](cajumixska) of @[](bhmtyxlqlm), on the floor by the ladder leading to the secret entrance/exit.


      The very distinctive hilt has a number of rubies embedded into it in the shape of a crescent moon. It is also a little larger than a normal dagger hilt.


      Maybe it belongs to @[](mqphnewbpw)?


      !!


      This is Inchen's dagger that she dropped while leaving when the party arrived. They could use it to look for clues of her true identity.


      The hilt came from a longsword originally and was embedded with diamonds. The previous owner was killed and Inchen took the blade, getting a blacksmith in Mekross to cut it off and graft it onto a dagger for her. While doing so, they replaced the diamonds with rubies.


      If the party can find the blacksmith, they may be able to recall who they made it for. Maybe with a little persuasion!


      *Maybe add a makers logo on the dagger to give another hint that it could be useful.*


      !!


      ## Properties


      The dagger is a **+1** dagger and does **rollable(1d4+1)** piercing damage.

  # Demo Campaign


  This is a simple, small campaign to show the functionality of The Goblin's Notebook.


  ## The Setting


  This story starts in the $[twwfzayehs] region, on the eastern shore of $[jiweqnxbdg]. It is spring time, the ground is drying up, but the $[qesmbwnchf] is still partly impassable. There has been an increase in bandit activity along the $[hjelnwbcjp] which is threatening the trade route through the $[ikvcfberca] of $[mtugsijbql] and $[uqgfukuaht]. the party, being an adventuring group looking for their next adventure, have come to investigate.


  ## Beginning the Adventure


  The party have arrived in Mekross and begin with no information, they will need to go and speak to people to start investigating the problem.
