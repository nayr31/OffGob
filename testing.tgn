      # $[objectname]


      A $[twwfzayehs] town on the coast of $[jiweqnxbdg], at the west end of the $[hjelnwbcjp]. The town has a large port and and is a key trade and transport hub for ships to a number of towns and cities around the lake.


      ## Points of Interest


      - **The Broken Vase Tavern**

      - **$[ruynchekbj]**


      The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a smallish town, although there isn't much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist shops and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of magic user in general and may not be as welcoming to them.

        The town on the western side of the river.


        ## Points of Interest


        - **Tavern** - The Owner is jealous of the tavern in Mekross and its owner's ability to super-chill drinks. People seem to prefer them and often head over the river instead of drinking here

        - **Basic Inn** - An inn with basic facilities for travellers passing through

        - **Luxury Inn** - A much more opulent inn for those wanting a more comfortable stay. Comes with a matching price tag

        - **Town Council Building** - Where all offical town business is carried out

        - **Church** ($[kswascfari]) - The only church in either of the Twin Towns


        A normal array of shops and services are also available in the town.

      # $[objectname]


      On the eastern edge of the $[twwfzayehs] region, what is seemingly one large walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate towns. On the west side is **$[mtugsijbql]**, on the east is **$[uqgfukuaht]**. They are connected by a number of bridges.


      The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.


      The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the more you dig for it. You wouldn't notice by looking but there is some real hatred between the towns.


      ## Key Positioning


      The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the $[hjelnwbcjp] and act as a gateway to the lands to the east.


      The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing traffic to other ports around $[jiweqnxbdg] which would mean few would come through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.

        # $[objectname]


        A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.


        ## Known History


        The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in $[kvsxvfmdfh]. He was famed for building 'indestructible' ships and lived a happy life in the village until his passing.


        ## Secret History


        Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with $[mxanfuwhdl] it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel and cannot burn.


        The magic wasn't permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.


        Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.


        ## But It Is Being Used


        After following leads and rumours, $[iokwfwzhvc] have recently been able to find $[mxanfuwhdl] and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood with the same magical power as before.


        $[nzgcbdcnjn] was built here.

      A small town in the $[twwfzayehs] region, on the shore where **The Rocky River** meets $[jiweqnxbdg]. The town has a small dock and does not have the capacity of the harbour in $[xxnjogoqxa].


      The town doesn't get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and their families. Over time, the population is falling as people move to more prosperous towns.


      ## Points Of Interest


      - **Tavern** - A modest tavern who can also scramble together some basic accommodation if needed

      - **The Dock** - Mainly just local fishing boats. Some boats are willing to transport people and small cargo down to $[xxnjogoqxa]

      - **$[jjrzlmtvbm]**

      - **Woodworkers** - There are a few woodworkers in the town who make a living fixing up fishing boats and creating and fixing tools for use on the boats

      - **Blacksmiths** - As the woodworkers, the local blacksmith makes a living making and fixing objects for the boats


      ---


      There are a few people who believe they have heard sounds from the sawmill recently but they are not being taken seriously by the rest of the village.

      Bandits are frequently seen along the road and holds-ups are commonplace. Most merchants and travelers will hire protection for the journey along the road.


      In the last few months, a man named $[omhfhzfhxc] has set up a business organising safe passage along the road, directly employing protection and running frequent group trips at a more affordable cost to individuals than if they were to go alone.

      Duskwood Den is a building complex in the Westown forest, south of the Devil's highway. Its existance isn't known by anyone outside $[iokwfwzhvc], who are using it as a headquarters for their raids on the nearby roads.


      ## Layout


      From the outside, it appears as a small complex surrounded by walls.


      There is a small guardhouse before getting to the main building. This guardhouse is where is $[ftwwvwecmn] often found as he checks people and good in and out of the hideout.


      Beyond that is the main building, a single storey building that looks like it would contain a few rooms.


      ## Basement


      One of the rooms contains a staircase down to a cellar. The cellar is very large and comprises of a number of rooms. There is another exit through a hatch directly outside the complex which is generally kept locked from both sides.

    This is an area that stretches from **$[xxnjogoqxa]** in the west to the twin towns of **$[mtugsijbql]** and **$[uqgfukuaht]** in the east to **$[kvsxvfmdfh]** in the North.


    ## Wetlands


    The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater, is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather. When the area floods, the only way to get to $[kvsxvfmdfh] is by boat as the road becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from $[xxnjogoqxa].


    ## The Rocky River


    To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters, make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but even they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the shoes is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate the river.


    Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single road passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


    ## Woodlands


    At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**, and some open grassland areas.

      Wilhye doesn't have much to pay for help in finding a cure and is concerned with revealing the truth, so is seeking to learn to cast spells himself in order to remove the effect.


      *His magical path, being a cleric, won't see him able to cast the required spells even if he were able to learn quick enough before the natural life of the cat comes to an end. He will need help but doesn't know it yet.*

    # $[objectname]


    Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand into $[twwfzayehs].


    They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale is currently extremely high.


    ## Identification


    The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform, as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels buildings.

    They are ruthless in their belief that any time a natural disaster strikes, those affected are completely deserving of the act.


    ## The Church


    The church will be hospitable and welcoming to the party and will offer them restorative services at a competitive cost.

    The party will need to find some information on what is going in the area. So far they only have rumours to go on and need to see if there is something more definitive to go on.


    They may decide, for example, to

    - [x] Seek out town officials

    - [ ] Ask some merchants who made trade with other towns

    - [x] Ask around in the local tavern

    - [ ] Whatever else they think of!

    - [x] Find a lead towards $[tzznfrlpqn]


    ## Progress


    Anyone in town who is willing to talk to the party will likely point them towards $[omhfhzfhxc] and the $[tzznfrlpqn], being the ones dealing directly with the problem.


    Edmor will be looking for help with $[wghdsmpvjm] and $[gphxkgmexf] and will see the potential of the party, offering them a reward for help.


    If the party make no progress in finding information, have Edmor come and find them, having noticed them and their potential.

    ## Secret


    They were attacked along $[hjelnwbcjp] by a larger and more organised group of bandits than has been making other recent attacks. Both protectors survived the attack but were left effectively for dead. They were able to gather themselves enough to go looking for food and water but ended up being caught be spiders who entwined them in webs to die.

      Once the party encounters the caged prisoner, be it $[omhfhzfhxc] or someone else, they should look for a way to release them.

      One way would be to take the cage to $[jjrzlmtvbm] where it's magic dispels and they can cut or break into it easily.


      There are likely other solutions that the party can come up with.

Players may add a similar one to log the encounter when it occurs but would more likely just put some notes or journal entries on the location object. The status would be set accordingly when the scene has either played out or becomes irrelevant.*


    # $[objectname]


    While travelling the road, the party will be attacked by bandits from $[iokwfwzhvc] (unless they take extreme measures to ensure this doesn't happen).


    It could be daylight or overnight, depending on when they set out and may be scaled according to if the party have hired some additional protection.


    ## Set Up


    A very well orchestrated attack will have $[iokwfwzhvc] try and kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc]. They have no interest in anything apart from his capture. If successful, they will take him to $[bhmtyxlqlm] where he will be held hostage. The reason is simply to disrupt the $[tzznfrlpqn] with the intentions of ending its operation.


    **Options**

    - Have the bandits attack while the party is tavelling

    - Have the bandits wait until the party stops and rests

    - Have the bandits pose as merchants escaping from bandits to try and gain the trust of the party. They have some magic users in their ranks so can easily pull of an attack with seemingly no equipment on them


    ---


    The encounter should include enough bandits to be a a reasonable threat, but it should include $[ftwwvwecmn] who is able to use a **scroll of slow**, **nets** and the **hold person spell** on the party in order to help capture Edmor.


    The main objective of the bandit attack is to capture Edmor and escape. They attackers will not be interested in fighting the party  unless they have to.

    # Document Wording


    It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns in the event of a 'crisis', but there is no mention of a return of power to Okforth at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control of both towns permanently.

    ## Disrupt The Trade Routes


    Disrupting the trade routes will cause uncertainty in the area and force trade around the whispering sea, including to other towns that they already have a stronger foothold in.


    ## Infiltrate Twin Towns Councils


    Meanwhile, they are using the compromised $[bkzzzegnhx] to gain influence in $[uqgfukuaht] with the intention of exploiting the clause in the $[sxfvfucbjd] to take control of $[mtugsijbql].

    Is a carved wooden cage, comfortably big enough for a human but with gaps between the 'bars' that are too small for a medium humanoid to fit through. It is made from a single piece of the trunk of a large tree so there are no joins or seams.


    ## Secret


    It was built in $[jjrzlmtvbm] and while it remains more than 1 mile from there, it will be as hard as the strongest steel and almost unbreakable. It is, however much lighter than steel and will float.


    ## Inhabitent


    If the bandits successfully kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc], he will be put in the box. Otherwise another member of $[tzznfrlpqn] or just a random NPC. If the camping doesn't go according to plan, it could even end up with a PC in there!


    The creature will be put into the cage via a (homebrew) teleport spell and an anti-magic field is then cast on the inside of the cage via a scroll. This should mean that there is no easy way out - no teleports, no bag of holding, etc.


    ## Why Are they Doing This?


    As a scare tactic to the $[tzznfrlpqn]. $[iokwfwzhvc] are planning on sneaking this into $[mtugsijbql] after a few nights (enough time for people to notice $[omhfhzfhxc] is missing), attach it to the floor in the market square, and leave it with a message to warn the Devil's Protection to halt operations and for travelers find alternative routes.

    In the $[bhmtyxlqlm] $[cajumixska], the party will come across $[mqphnewbpw]. She will be accompanied by a number of bandits who will fight to the death for her, but she will not stay and fight herself. As soon as she knows of the party's presence in the den, she will run through the western-tunnel exit then bolt an lock the hatch from the outside.


    Once outside, she will grab a horse from the front of the complex, ride to $[xxnjogoqxa] and board an $[iokwfwzhvc] boat headed for $[svflxcdrna].


    The bandits in the den will serve to delay the party long enough for Scars to get a good head-start.


    There should be some indication of where she headed, maybe **a note left in the corridor telling her to flee to Westown** that the party can find.

  # Demo Campaign


  This is a simple, small campaign to show the functionality of The Goblin's Notebook.


  ## The Setting


  This story starts in the $[twwfzayehs] region, on the eastern shore of $[jiweqnxbdg]. It is spring time, the ground is drying up, but the $[qesmbwnchf] is still partly impassable. There has been an increase in bandit activity along the $[hjelnwbcjp] which is threatening the trade route through the $[ikvcfberca] of $[mtugsijbql] and $[uqgfukuaht]. the party, being an adventuring group looking for their next adventure, have come to investigate.


  ## Beginning the Adventure


  The party have arrived in Mekross and begin with no information, they will need to go and speak to people to start investigating the problem.
