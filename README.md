# OffGob

[The Goblin Notebook](the-goblin.net) is an online-only website for notebook creation, and is a really good tool for it. However, sometimes one wants to have a local copy of their notebooks, and this is where OffGob comes in.

OffGob is a third-party tool that has some features to interact with your notebook without needing an internet connection.

**Note:** Tested using the default Demo data from the Goblin website, there may be bugs. After checking the "Known bugs" section below, contact me on discord @gamernayr#8165 with as much information as possible if it is not present.

## Features

- Export your campaign file into a folder structure to be used elsewhere.
- Recombine your saved changes to be imported back onto the site.
- Create an object for convenient importing later.
- Bulk create objects for mass importing. Check out the [DnD SRD](https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki/) compendium for files.

## Known bugs

- Creating an item manually (ie. creating a folder) and then creating another item inside of it in the hierarchy causes an import error going back on the site.
- After importing a newly created `.tgn` file, white squares will shown up beside each object. Simply refresh the page to get rid of them. Those are false flags.
