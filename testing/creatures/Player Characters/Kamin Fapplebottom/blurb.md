# $[objectname]

Gnomish bard. Long-standing relationship with $[jvqixtudyt] who has often made use of their services after getting into scuffles and scrapes from rubbing people up the wrong way, usually after a few drinks.

Has been adventuring with $[olbkcxwcxi] for some time. The two have developed a close bond.
