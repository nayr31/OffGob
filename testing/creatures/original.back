      A black cat who often follows $[ukqnmaekls] around town and stays close to him.


      ## Secret


      Isabelle is a human who polymorphed into a cat around 1 year ago. After she stayed close by for some time, $[ukqnmaekls] eventually was able to find someone to cast a spell allowing him to speak with animals when he found out the truth. Since then he has been seeking a cure.


      Wilhye doesn't have much to pay for help in finding a cure and is concerned with revealing the truth, so is seeking to learn to cast spells himself in order to remove the effect.


      *His magical path, being a cleric, won't see him able to cast the required spells even if he were able to learn quick enough before the natural life of the cat comes to an end. He will need help but doesn't know it yet.*
