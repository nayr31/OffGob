    ## Devil's Protection


    Rynis currently working as a protector for the $[tzznfrlpqn] and has not yet returned from his latest commission with the company.


    ## Location


    Ryn survived the bandit attack on the caravan heavily injured, but struggled a short distance away in search of food and water. He ended up in a $[vnfayumnxv] where he was too weak to fight back. A giant spider wrapped him in a web, where he remains unable to escape. **If found within 1 day he will still be alive**.
