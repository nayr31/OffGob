    The party will need to find some information on what is going in the area. So far they only have rumours to go on and need to see if there is something more definitive to go on.


    They may decide, for example, to

    - [x] Seek out town officials

    - [ ] Ask some merchants who made trade with other towns

    - [x] Ask around in the local tavern

    - [ ] Whatever else they think of!

    - [x] Find a lead towards $[tzznfrlpqn]


    ## Progress


    Anyone in town who is willing to talk to the party will likely point them towards $[omhfhzfhxc] and the $[tzznfrlpqn], being the ones dealing directly with the problem.


    Edmor will be looking for help with $[wghdsmpvjm] and $[gphxkgmexf] and will see the potential of the party, offering them a reward for help.


    If the party make no progress in finding information, have Edmor come and find them, having noticed them and their potential.

    # $[objectname]


    Some of the $[tzznfrlpqn] have not come back from their latest commission. **$[uqmasyyfck]** and **$[bmulwambsf]** were accompanying a convoy of five caravans to $[xxnjogoqxa] but there has been no sign of either the protectors or the caravans since they left.


    !!


    ## Secret


    They were attacked along $[hjelnwbcjp] by a larger and more organised group of bandits than has been making other recent attacks. Both protectors survived the attack but were left effectively for dead. They were able to gather themselves enough to go looking for food and water but ended up being caught be spiders who entwined them in webs to die.

      Once the party encounters the caged prisoner, be it $[omhfhzfhxc] or someone else, they should look for a way to release them.


      ## Possible Solution


      One way would be to take the cage to $[jjrzlmtvbm] where it's magic dispels and they can cut or break into it easily.


      There are likely other solutions that the party can come up with.
