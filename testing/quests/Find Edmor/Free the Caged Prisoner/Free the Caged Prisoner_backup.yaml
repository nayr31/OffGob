  Once the party encounters the caged prisoner, be it $[omhfhzfhxc] or someone else,
  they should look for a way to release them.


  ## Possible Solution


  One way would be to take the cage to $[jjrzlmtvbm] where it''s magic dispels and
  they can cut or break into it easily.


  There are likely other solutions that the party can come up with.'
