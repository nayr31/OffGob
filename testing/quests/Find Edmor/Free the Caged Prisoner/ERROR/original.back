  # $[objectname]
  Once the party encounters the caged prisoner, be it $[omhfhzfhxc] or someone else, they should look for a way to release them.
  ## Possible Solution
  One way would be to take the cage to $[jjrzlmtvbm] where it's magic dispels and they can cut or break into it easily.
  There are likely other solutions that the party can come up with.
