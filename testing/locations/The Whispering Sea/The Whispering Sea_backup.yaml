blurb: "> ***Demo** - This is an example of an object that may be added by GM and\
  \ players. The GM would have notes on important information and connections (known\
  \ to players or not) and may include maps and POI including sub-locations that aren't\
  \ important enough to need an object themselves. Players may just use the object\
  \ as a place to put notes and make connections.*\n\n# $[objectname]\n\nA large freshwater\
  \ lake with a number of settlements along the coastline. Fish are abundant in the\
  \ waters and boats are constantly travelling between ports, transporting people\
