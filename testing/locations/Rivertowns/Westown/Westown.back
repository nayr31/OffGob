    ## Points of Interest
    - **The Broken Vase Tavern**
    - **$[ruynchekbj]**
    The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a smallish town, although there isn't much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist shops and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of magic user in general and may not be as welcoming to them.
