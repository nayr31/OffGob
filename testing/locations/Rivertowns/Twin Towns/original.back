- locations:
    On the eastern edge of the $[twwfzayehs] region, what is seemingly one large walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate towns. On the west side is **$[mtugsijbql]**, on the east is **$[uqgfukuaht]**. They are connected by a number of bridges.
    The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.
    The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the more you dig for it. You wouldn't notice by looking but there is some real hatred between the towns.
    ## Key Positioning
    The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the $[hjelnwbcjp] and act as a gateway to the lands to the east.
    The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing traffic to other ports around $[jiweqnxbdg] which would mean few would come through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.
