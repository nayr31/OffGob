The town on the western side of the river.

## Points of Interest

- **Tavern** - The Owner is jealous of the tavern in Mekross and its owner's ability to super-chill drinks. People seem to prefer them and often head over the river instead of drinking here
- **Basic Inn** - An inn with basic facilities for travellers passing through
- **Luxury Inn** - A much more opulent inn for those wanting a more comfortable stay. Comes with a matching price tag
- **Town Council Building** - Where all offical town business is carried out
- **Church** ($[kswascfari]) - The only church in either of the Twin Towns

A normal array of shops and services are also available in the town.
