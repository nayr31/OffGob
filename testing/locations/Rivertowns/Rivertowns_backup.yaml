blurb: '# $[objectname]


  This is an area that stretches from **$[xxnjogoqxa]** in the west to the twin towns
  of **$[mtugsijbql]** and **$[uqgfukuaht]** in the east to **$[kvsxvfmdfh]** in the
  North.


  ## Wetlands


  The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater,
  is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather.
  When the area floods, the only way to get to $[kvsxvfmdfh] is by boat as the road
  becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from $[xxnjogoqxa].


  ## The Rocky River


  To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests
  is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters,
  make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but even
  they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially
  when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the shoes
  is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate
  the river.


  Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single road
  passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


  ## Woodlands


  At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**, and
  some open grassland areas.
