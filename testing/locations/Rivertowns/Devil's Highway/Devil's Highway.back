    # $[objectname]
    The road connecting $[xxnjogoqxa] and the twin towns of $[mtugsijbql] and $[uqgfukuaht].
    ## Bandits
    Bandits are frequently seen along the road and holds-ups are commonplace. Most merchants and travelers will hire protection for the journey along the road.
    In the last few months, a man named $[omhfhzfhxc] has set up a business organising safe passage along the road, directly employing protection and running frequent group trips at a more affordable cost to individuals than if they were to go alone.
