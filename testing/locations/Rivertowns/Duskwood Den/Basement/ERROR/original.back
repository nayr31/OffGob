  The basement is very large (much larger than the building above) and comprises of a number of rooms. In the north-west corner, there is a ladder leading to up to a hatch. The hatch open up inside the trunk of a large dead tree in the forest. It can be bolted and locked from top and bottom to be secured without someone opening it from both sides.
