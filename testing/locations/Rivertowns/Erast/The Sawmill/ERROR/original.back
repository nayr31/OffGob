  # $[objectname]
  A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.
  ## Known History
  The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in $[kvsxvfmdfh]. He was famed for building 'indestructible' ships and lived a happy life in the village until his passing.
  ## Secret History
  Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with $[mxanfuwhdl] it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel and cannot burn.
  The magic wasn't permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.
  Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.
  ## But It Is Being Used
  After following leads and rumours, $[iokwfwzhvc] have recently been able to find $[mxanfuwhdl] and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood with the same magical power as before.
  $[nzgcbdcnjn] was built here.
