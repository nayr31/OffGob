  # $[objectname]
  A small town in the $[twwfzayehs] region, on the shore where **The Rocky River** meets $[jiweqnxbdg]. The town has a small dock and does not have the capacity of the harbour in $[xxnjogoqxa].
  The town doesn't get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and their families. Over time, the population is falling as people move to more prosperous towns.
