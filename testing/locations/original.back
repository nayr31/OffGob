      # $[objectname]


      A $[twwfzayehs] town on the coast of $[jiweqnxbdg], at the west end of the $[hjelnwbcjp]. The town has a large port and and is a key trade and transport hub for ships to a number of towns and cities around the lake.


      ## Points of Interest


      - **The Broken Vase Tavern**

      - **$[ruynchekbj]**


      The town has the usual array of goods and services that would be found in a smallish town, although there isn't much magical, there is no alchemy or herbalist shops and no magical-services available. The population is a little wary of magic user in general and may not be as welcoming to them.

        ## Points of Interest


        - **Tavern** - The Owner is jealous of the tavern in Mekross and its owner's ability to super-chill drinks. People seem to prefer them and often head over the river instead of drinking here

        - **Basic Inn** - An inn with basic facilities for travellers passing through

        - **Luxury Inn** - A much more opulent inn for those wanting a more comfortable stay. Comes with a matching price tag

        - **Town Council Building** - Where all offical town business is carried out

        - **Church** ($[kswascfari]) - The only church in either of the Twin Towns


        A normal array of shops and services are also available in the town.

      # $[objectname]


      On the eastern edge of the $[twwfzayehs] region, what is seemingly one large walled city spread across the meandering Rocky River is actually two separate towns. On the west side is **$[mtugsijbql]**, on the east is **$[uqgfukuaht]**. They are connected by a number of bridges.


      The towns are run completely separately but they are an important river crossing and stopover for merchants and travelers which has gives the towns a strong desire to work together to ensure the smooth operation of the trade route.


      The townsfolk are generally (but not exclusively) friendly and welcoming but there is a rivalry between Okforth and Mekross which becomes more obvious the more you dig for it. You wouldn't notice by looking but there is some real hatred between the towns.


      ## Key Positioning


      The towns are a key river crossing at the eastern end of the $[hjelnwbcjp] and act as a gateway to the lands to the east.


      The recent increase in bandit activity is threatening to route much of the passing traffic to other ports around $[jiweqnxbdg] which would mean few would come through the Twin Towns, and would be financially devastating to the towns.

        # $[objectname]


        A derelict building of brick and slate, filled with complex dwarven machines. It is apparent that the building is a sawmill, but no-one has been able to work out how to operate it in many generations.


        ## Known History


        The sawmill was built around 200 years ago by **Lowdan Kappla**, a dwarven carpenter, who became a known as a master ship builder in $[kvsxvfmdfh]. He was famed for building 'indestructible' ships and lived a happy life in the village until his passing.


        ## Secret History


        Lowdan had enchanted the sawmill so that when operating it with $[mxanfuwhdl] it would give magical properties to wood cut there. When the wood moves more than 1 mile from the sawmill, it hardens stronger than the strongest steel and cannot burn.


        The magic wasn't permeant though. Over a period of years it gradually lost its magical strength, eventually returning back to normal wood.


        Over time, the ships eventually broke down and the wood generally discarded where it returned to normal before decomposing naturally.


        ## But It Is Being Used


        After following leads and rumours, $[iokwfwzhvc] have recently been able to find $[mxanfuwhdl] and have started to operate the sawmill, creating wood with the same magical power as before.


        $[nzgcbdcnjn] was built here.

      A small town in the $[twwfzayehs] region, on the shore where **The Rocky River** meets $[jiweqnxbdg]. The town has a small dock and does not have the capacity of the harbour in $[xxnjogoqxa].


      The town doesn't get many visitors, especially spring to autumn when the road is impassible. It is now mainly just made up of local fishing boat crews and their families. Over time, the population is falling as people move to more prosperous towns.


      ## Points Of Interest


      - **Tavern** - A modest tavern who can also scramble together some basic accommodation if needed

      - **The Dock** - Mainly just local fishing boats. Some boats are willing to transport people and small cargo down to $[xxnjogoqxa]

      - **$[jjrzlmtvbm]**

      - **Woodworkers** - There are a few woodworkers in the town who make a living fixing up fishing boats and creating and fixing tools for use on the boats

      - **Blacksmiths** - As the woodworkers, the local blacksmith makes a living making and fixing objects for the boats

      There are a few people who believe they have heard sounds from the sawmill recently but they are not being taken seriously by the rest of the village.

      In the last few months, a man named $[omhfhzfhxc] has set up a business organising safe passage along the road, directly employing protection and running frequent group trips at a more affordable cost to individuals than if they were to go alone.

The hatch open up inside the trunk of a large dead tree in the forest. It can be bolted and locked from top and bottom to be secured without someone opening it from both sides.

      Duskwood Den is a building complex in the Westown forest, south of the Devil's highway. Its existance isn't known by anyone outside $[iokwfwzhvc], who are using it as a headquarters for their raids on the nearby roads.


      ## Layout


      From the outside, it appears as a small complex surrounded by walls.


      There is a small guardhouse before getting to the main building. This guardhouse is where is $[ftwwvwecmn] often found as he checks people and good in and out of the hideout.


      Beyond that is the main building, a single storey building that looks like it would contain a few rooms.


      ## Basement


      One of the rooms contains a staircase down to a cellar. The cellar is very large and comprises of a number of rooms. There is another exit through a hatch directly outside the complex which is generally kept locked from both sides.

    This is an area that stretches from **$[xxnjogoqxa]** in the west to the twin towns of **$[mtugsijbql]** and **$[uqgfukuaht]** in the east to **$[kvsxvfmdfh]** in the North.


    ## Wetlands


    The northern half is mainly wetlands which spend most of the winter and underwater, is mostly dry in the summer, and spring and autumn depend on the recent weather. When the area floods, the only way to get to $[kvsxvfmdfh] is by boat as the road becomes impassable. Boats are generally available from $[xxnjogoqxa].


    ## The Rocky River


    To the north and east of the region is the Rocky River, which as the name suggests is a very rocky stretch of water. This combined with the generally shallow waters, make it unsuitable for shipping. Smaller craft can try and sail the waters but even they may find it too difficult. The chance of hitting rocks is high, especially when the river is flowing fast. The number of broken pieces of boats along the shoes is testament to challenging conditions sailors face when attempting to navigate the river.


    Beyond the river are the **Quentulus Quazgar** mountains. There is just single road passing through the mountains form **Mekross** to lands east of the range.


    ## Woodlands


    At the south of the region is a mixture of forest, known as **The Duskwood**, and some open grassland areas.
