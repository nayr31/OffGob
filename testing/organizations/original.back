    # $[objectname]


    Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand into $[twwfzayehs].


    They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale is currently extremely high.


    ## Identification


    The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform, as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels buildings.

    # $[objectname]


    The Church is based on the belief that storms and other natural disasters are their God's way of punishing people, and have made it their responsibility as followers to guide the population to the path of good in order to avoid this.


    They are ruthless in their belief that any time a natural disaster strikes, those affected are completely deserving of the act.


    ## The Church


    The church will be hospitable and welcoming to the party and will offer them restorative services at a competitive cost.
