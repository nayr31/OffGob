    Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working
    for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has
    a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand
    into $[twwfzayehs].


    They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale
    is currently extremely high.


    ## Identification


    The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn
    on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform,
    as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could
    be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The
    insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels
    buildings.

  blurb: '# $[objectname]


    The Church is based on the belief that storms and other natural disasters are
    their God''s way of punishing people, and have made it their responsibility as
    followers to guide the population to the path of good in order to avoid this.


    They are ruthless in their belief that any time a natural disaster strikes, those
    affected are completely deserving of the act.


    ## The Church


    The church will be hospitable and welcoming to the party and will offer them restorative
    services at a competitive cost.'
