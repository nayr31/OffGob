blurb: '# $[objectname]


  The Church is based on the belief that storms and other natural disasters are their
  God''s way of punishing people, and have made it their responsibility as followers
  to guide the population to the path of good in order to avoid this.


  They are ruthless in their belief that any time a natural disaster strikes, those
  affected are completely deserving of the act.


  ## The Church


  The church will be hospitable and welcoming to the party and will offer them restorative
  services at a competitive cost.'
