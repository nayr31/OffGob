# $[objectname]

Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand into $[twwfzayehs].

They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale is currently extremely high.

## Identification

The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform, as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could be a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The insignia is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels buildings.
