blurb: '> ***Demo** - This is an example of an object that may be added by GM and
  players. The GM would have notes on important information and connections (known
  to players or not). Players would tend to note down important information about
  them and add any connections known about.*


  # $[objectname]


  Led by $[mqphnewbpw] under her **Scars** persona, with a number of people working
  for her, notably second in command $[ftwwvwecmn]. The criminal organisation has
  a presence in a couple of towns around $[jiweqnxbdg] and is looking to expand into
  $[twwfzayehs].


  They are making decent money at the moment and paying staff very well. Morale is
  currently extremely high.


  ## Identification


  The bandits always wear something coloured deep purple and carry an insignia drawn
  on a piece on leather. The purple item can be anything, it is not like a uniform,
  as long as it can be noticed easily by others who are looking for it. It could be
  a wrap of cloth round an arm, a bandana, some gloves, anything can work. The insignia
  is used as identification for instance for gaining access to bandit heels buildings.
