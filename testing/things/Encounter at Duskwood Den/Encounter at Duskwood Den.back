    # $[objectname]


    In the $[bhmtyxlqlm] $[cajumixska], the party will come across $[mqphnewbpw]. She will be accompanied by a number of bandits who will fight to the death for her, but she will not stay and fight herself. As soon as she knows of the party's presence in the den, she will run through the western-tunnel exit then bolt an lock the hatch from the outside.


    Once outside, she will grab a horse from the front of the complex, ride to $[xxnjogoqxa] and board an $[iokwfwzhvc] boat headed for $[svflxcdrna].


    The bandits in the den will serve to delay the party long enough for Scars to get a good head-start.


    There should be some indication of where she headed, maybe **a note left in the corridor telling her to flee to Westown** that the party can find.
