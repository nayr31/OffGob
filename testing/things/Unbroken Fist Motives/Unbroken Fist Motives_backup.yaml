  The bandits have a few plays...


  ## Disrupt The Trade Routes


  Disrupting the trade routes will cause uncertainty in the area and force trade around
  the whispering sea, including to other towns that they already have a stronger foothold
  in.


  ## Infiltrate Twin Towns Councils


  Meanwhile, they are using the compromised $[bkzzzegnhx] to gain influence in $[uqgfukuaht]
  with the intention of exploiting the clause in the $[sxfvfucbjd] to take control
  of $[mtugsijbql].


  ## Use The Sawmill

  income stream.'
