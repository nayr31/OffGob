  This document details the agreement between the twin towns to work together to allow
  travel between and through the towns.


  No-one knows exactly what it says (despite it being publicly available information)
  as it is too complicated for the average commoner, but there is a general understanding
  of it''s contents.


  # Document Wording


  It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to
  mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns in
  the event of a ''crisis'', but there is no mention of a return of power to Okforth
  at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control of both
  towns permanently.'
