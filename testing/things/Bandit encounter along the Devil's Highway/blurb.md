> ***Demo** - This is an example of a scene that a GM may use as a planned encounter. Players may add a similar one to log the encounter when it occurs but would more likely just put some notes or journal entries on the location object. The status would be set accordingly when the scene has either played out or becomes irrelevant.*

# $[objectname]

While travelling the road, the party will be attacked by bandits from $[iokwfwzhvc] (unless they take extreme measures to ensure this doesn't happen).

It could be daylight or overnight, depending on when they set out and may be scaled according to if the party have hired some additional protection.

## Set Up

A very well orchestrated attack will have $[iokwfwzhvc] try and kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc]. They have no interest in anything apart from his capture. If successful, they will take him to $[bhmtyxlqlm] where he will be held hostage. The reason is simply to disrupt the $[tzznfrlpqn] with the intentions of ending its operation.

**Options**
- Have the bandits attack while the party is tavelling
- Have the bandits wait until the party stops and rests
- Have the bandits pose as merchants escaping from bandits to try and gain the trust of the party. They have some magic users in their ranks so can easily pull of an attack with seemingly no equipment on them

---

The encounter should include enough bandits to be a a reasonable threat, but it should include $[ftwwvwecmn] who is able to use a **scroll of slow**, **nets** and the **hold person spell** on the party in order to help capture Edmor.

The main objective of the bandit attack is to capture Edmor and escape. They attackers will not be interested in fighting the party  unless they have to.
