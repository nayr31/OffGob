    > ***Demo** - This is an example of a scene that a GM may use as a planned encounter. Players may add a similar one to log the encounter when it occurs but would more likely just put some notes or journal entries on the location object. The status would be set accordingly when the scene has either played out or becomes irrelevant.*


    # $[objectname]


    While travelling the road, the party will be attacked by bandits from $[iokwfwzhvc] (unless they take extreme measures to ensure this doesn't happen).


    It could be daylight or overnight, depending on when they set out and may be scaled according to if the party have hired some additional protection.


    ## Set Up


    A very well orchestrated attack will have $[iokwfwzhvc] try and kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc]. They have no interest in anything apart from his capture. If successful, they will take him to $[bhmtyxlqlm] where he will be held hostage. The reason is simply to disrupt the $[tzznfrlpqn] with the intentions of ending its operation.


    **Options**

    - Have the bandits attack while the party is tavelling

    - Have the bandits wait until the party stops and rests

    - Have the bandits pose as merchants escaping from bandits to try and gain the trust of the party. They have some magic users in their ranks so can easily pull of an attack with seemingly no equipment on them


    ---


    The encounter should include enough bandits to be a a reasonable threat, but it should include $[ftwwvwecmn] who is able to use a **scroll of slow**, **nets** and the **hold person spell** on the party in order to help capture Edmor.


    The main objective of the bandit attack is to capture Edmor and escape. They attackers will not be interested in fighting the party  unless they have to.

    # $[objectname]


    This document details the agreement between the twin towns to work together to allow travel between and through the towns.


    No-one knows exactly what it says (despite it being publicly available information) as it is too complicated for the average commoner, but there is a general understanding of it's contents.


    # Document Wording


    It is written in legal terms but there is a clause that could be interpreted to mean that the current Mayor of **Mekross** could assume control of both towns in the event of a 'crisis', but there is no mention of a return of power to Okforth at any point after. This could mean someone could effectively seize control of both towns permanently.

    The bandits have a few plays...


    ## Disrupt The Trade Routes


    Disrupting the trade routes will cause uncertainty in the area and force trade around the whispering sea, including to other towns that they already have a stronger foothold in.


    ## Infiltrate Twin Towns Councils


    Meanwhile, they are using the compromised $[bkzzzegnhx] to gain influence in $[uqgfukuaht] with the intention of exploiting the clause in the $[sxfvfucbjd] to take control of $[mtugsijbql].


    ## Use The Sawmill


    With the knowledge of how to work $[jjrzlmtvbm] and what it can do, they plan to use items made there to to help their cause as well as providing an additional legitimate income stream.

    # $[objectname]


    Is a carved wooden cage, comfortably big enough for a human but with gaps between the 'bars' that are too small for a medium humanoid to fit through. It is made from a single piece of the trunk of a large tree so there are no joins or seams.


    ## Secret


    It was built in $[jjrzlmtvbm] and while it remains more than 1 mile from there, it will be as hard as the strongest steel and almost unbreakable. It is, however much lighter than steel and will float.


    ## Inhabitent


    If the bandits successfully kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc], he will be put in the box. Otherwise another member of $[tzznfrlpqn] or just a random NPC. If the camping doesn't go according to plan, it could even end up with a PC in there!


    The creature will be put into the cage via a (homebrew) teleport spell and an anti-magic field is then cast on the inside of the cage via a scroll. This should mean that there is no easy way out - no teleports, no bag of holding, etc.


    ## Why Are they Doing This?


    As a scare tactic to the $[tzznfrlpqn]. $[iokwfwzhvc] are planning on sneaking this into $[mtugsijbql] after a few nights (enough time for people to notice $[omhfhzfhxc] is missing), attach it to the floor in the market square, and leave it with a message to warn the Devil's Protection to halt operations and for travelers find alternative routes.

    This is a small hexagonal amulet on a silver chain. It is made from wood and has a carving of an anvil on the front. The chain is looking a little worse for wares but the pendant is in pristine condition.


    ## Secret


    The amulet is the key to $[jjrzlmtvbm] and had been lost for generations. It was recently found by $[mqphnewbpw] who has found the secret of the sawmill. The pendant itself is virtually indestructible.

    In the $[bhmtyxlqlm] $[cajumixska], the party will come across $[mqphnewbpw]. She will be accompanied by a number of bandits who will fight to the death for her, but she will not stay and fight herself. As soon as she knows of the party's presence in the den, she will run through the western-tunnel exit then bolt an lock the hatch from the outside.


    Once outside, she will grab a horse from the front of the complex, ride to $[xxnjogoqxa] and board an $[iokwfwzhvc] boat headed for $[svflxcdrna].


    The bandits in the den will serve to delay the party long enough for Scars to get a good head-start.


    There should be some indication of where she headed, maybe **a note left in the corridor telling her to flee to Westown** that the party can find.
