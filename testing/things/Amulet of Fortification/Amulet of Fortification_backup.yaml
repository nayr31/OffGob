blurb: '# $[objectname]


  This is a small hexagonal amulet on a silver chain. It is made from wood and has
  a carving of an anvil on the front. The chain is looking a little worse for wares
  but the pendant is in pristine condition.


  ## Secret


  The amulet is the key to $[jjrzlmtvbm] and had been lost for generations. It was
  recently found by $[mqphnewbpw] who has found the secret of the sawmill. The pendant
  itself is virtually indestructible.'
