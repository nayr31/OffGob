# $[objectname]

Is a carved wooden cage, comfortably big enough for a human but with gaps between the 'bars' that are too small for a medium humanoid to fit through. It is made from a single piece of the trunk of a large tree so there are no joins or seams.

## Secret

It was built in $[jjrzlmtvbm] and while it remains more than 1 mile from there, it will be as hard as the strongest steel and almost unbreakable. It is, however much lighter than steel and will float.

## Inhabitent

If the bandits successfully kidnap $[omhfhzfhxc], he will be put in the box. Otherwise another member of $[tzznfrlpqn] or just a random NPC. If the camping doesn't go according to plan, it could even end up with a PC in there!

The creature will be put into the cage via a (homebrew) teleport spell and an anti-magic field is then cast on the inside of the cage via a scroll. This should mean that there is no easy way out - no teleports, no bag of holding, etc.

## Why Are they Doing This?

As a scare tactic to the $[tzznfrlpqn]. $[iokwfwzhvc] are planning on sneaking this into $[mtugsijbql] after a few nights (enough time for people to notice $[omhfhzfhxc] is missing), attach it to the floor in the market square, and leave it with a message to warn the Devil's Protection to halt operations and for travelers find alternative routes.
